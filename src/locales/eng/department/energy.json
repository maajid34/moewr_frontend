    "p1": "Jubaland's energy sector mixes traditional and modern sources, with a growing focus on renewables. Many households rely on diesel generators and biomass, while efforts are underway to expand clean, sustainable energy. Challenges include weak infrastructure, high tariffs, and limited grid connectivity. Abundant solar and wind give strong potential, and the government is working to attract investment, raise electrification, and improve efficiency. The Energy Department within the Ministry develops policies, regulates the sector, oversees infrastructure, and ensures a sustainable, reliable supply with teams spanning engineers, specialists and technicians."
